# **Simple Calculator Web Application**

## **Overview**
This project is a responsive and user-friendly calculator web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app also supports advanced functions like clearing the display (AC), deleting the last entry (DEL), and evaluating the entered expression (=).

## **Features**
- **Basic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- **Special Functions**: 
  - **AC**: Clears the entire input.
  - **DEL**: Deletes the last character of the input.
  - **=**: Evaluates the mathematical expression.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Styled UI**: Background image, animated buttons, and modern shadow effects.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Styling, layout, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for button interactions and calculation logic.

## **How to Run**
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Use the on-screen buttons to perform calculations.

## **Code Explanation**
- **HTML**: Defines the layout of the calculator with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions (AC, DEL, =).
- **CSS**: Adds visual appeal with background images, shadows, and hover effects on buttons.
- **JavaScript**: Handles button clicks and manages operations, such as input, delete, clear, and evaluation.

## **Usage Instructions**
1. Click on the number buttons to enter values.
2. Use operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to specify operations.
3. Click the **=** button to see the result.
4. Use **AC** to clear all input or **DEL** to remove the last entry.
